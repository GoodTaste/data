## I. Introduction

As agricultural practices continue to evolve, it is imperative that approaches to land management and associated processes are focused on contributing to the health of ecosystems, including human communities. Regenerative Organic Certified® builds upon and furthers the near 100-year legacy of organic movement visionaries like J. I. Rodale, Lady Eve Balfour, Dr. Rudolf Steiner, Sir Albert Howard, and the knowledge of generations of diverse, holistic producers—including native and Indigenous Peoples—that they channeled for inspiration and direction.

The goal of Regenerative Organic Certified® is to promote holistic agriculture practices in an all-encompassing certification that:

- Increases soil organic matter over time and sequesters carbon below and above ground, which could be a tool to mitigate climate change;
- Improves animal welfare; and
- Provides economic stability and fairness for farmers, ranchers, and workers.

Regenerative Organic Certified® consists of three pillars: Soil Health & Land Management, Animal Welfare, and Farmer & Worker Fairness. Regenerative Organic Certified® has three levels: Bronze, Silver, and Gold. Each requires a different number and scope of regenerative organic practices used.

### Program Management

Regenerative Organic Certified® is overseen by the nonprofit Regenerative Organic Alliance (ROA). The ROA is a group of experts in farming, ranching, soil health, animal welfare, and farmer & worker fairness. The ROA has been established to continuously review and update the Regenerative Organic Certified® guidelines.

Founders of the ROA as well as organizations and companies currently represented on the Board of Directors include:

- Compassion in World Farming
- Dr. Bronner
- Fair World Project
- Lighthouse Farming Network
- Patagonia
- Rodale Institute
- Textile Exchange
- White Oak Pastures
- Dark Horse Vineyards

Review subcommittees for Regenerative Organic Certified® are comprised of the following stakeholders:

- Farmers, ranchers, and farmworkers
- Auditors
- Social and animal welfare non-governmental organizations
- Veterinarians with farm-animal expertise
- Agricultural economists
- Environmental non-governmental organizations
- Certification and standard experts and qualified trade organizations
- Retailers, food companies, and brands that support regenerative practices

## II. Leveraging & Advancing Existing Standards

### Baseline Requirement: USDA Organic or International Equivalent

To achieve Regenerative Organic Certified®, an entity must first hold USDA organic certification or an international equivalent formally recognized by the National Organic Program (NOP). Regenerative Organic Certified® adds criteria and builds off the NOP and equivalent standards. Operations will not be eligible for Regenerative Organic Certified® at any level until they achieve USDA Organic certification. Engagement in transitional programs is encouraged but not required for Regenerative Organic Certified®.

To earn Regenerative Organic Certified®, all requirements listed in this document must be met; and all products sold, labeled, or represented as regenerative organic must also comply with USDA organic regulations at 7 CFR Part 205, National Organic Program. International operators applying for Regenerative Organic Certified® must be certified to an authorized international standard. See "NOP International Equivalents" at RegenOrganic.org/Resources for more information.

This framework is a living document and thus will be continuously reviewed and revised by a committee of experts as new best practices emerge. At the same time, Regenerative Organic Certified® will always be tied, at a minimum, to all requirements, policies, interpretations, and determinations of NOP and authorized third-party certifying bodies operating on NOP's behalf. Any ambiguity or issue that arises as to application of the Regenerative Organic Certified® program shall always be resolved in favor of consistency with NOP requirements when the issue falls within the purview of NOP.

### Other Applicable Certifications

Regenerative Organic Certified® was created to leverage and bring together existing high-bar certifications in order to avoid duplicative audits or burdensome paperwork. Regenerative Organic Certified® recognizes the strong work already conducted by existing standard bodies.

Producers can demonstrate compliance with Regenerative Organic Certified® criteria by leveraging certifications they've already earned, such as Animal Welfare Approved or Demeter Biodynamic, among others. A full list of Regenerative Organic Certified® criteria met by existing certifications can be found in the "Required Baseline Certifications and Equivalency Assessment" at RegenOrganic.org/Resources. Producers will need third-party verification of any required Regenerative Organic Certified® standards not met by their existing certification.

## III. Scope & Structure

### Scope

Regenerative Organic Certified® covers requirements for farming and ranching operations, transportation, slaughter, and certain processing facilities. Operations may be of any size. Regenerative Organic Certified® seeks to create change across a wide variety of farms & ranches in order to scale best practices to the widest audience possible.

### Structure

Regenerative Organic Certified® is built on three pillars: Soil Health & Land Management, Animal Welfare, and Social Fairness, with required criteria for each. There are three levels of Regenerative Organic Certified®: Bronze, Silver, and Gold. Bronze represents the beginning level, and Gold represents the highest achievable level in regenerative organic production. This tiered approach enables producers to adjust and adapt their practices over time and allows for continuous improvement. Annual recertification audits are required at all levels.

#### Levels of Regenerative Organic Certified®

- Bronze: To claim Regenerative Organic Certified® at the Bronze level, at least 10% of fiber-or food-producing land within an operation must be certified at initial certification and must reach at least 50% by year five. Alternatively, the certified portion may represent at least 10% of the operation's revenue derived from food or fiber production. Claims about organic and regenerative organic can only be made about products specifically grown on land that is already certified organic. Any organic and regenerative organic labeling must also abide by USDA organic labeling regulations.

- Silver: To claim Regenerative Organic Certified® at the Silver level, at least 50% of fiber-or food-producing land, or revenue from Regenerative Organic Certified® crops, within an operation must be certified at initial certification and must reach at least 75% by year five. Alternatively, the certified portion may represent at least 50% of the operation's revenue derived from food or fiber production. Claims about organic and regenerative organic can only be made about products produced from land that is already certified organic. Any organic and regenerative organic labeling must also abide by USDA organic labeling regulations.

- Gold: To claim Regenerative Organic Certified® at the Gold level, 100% of fiber-or food-producing land of an operation must be certified, representing 100% of revenue derived from food or fiber production. Any organic and regenerative organic labeling must also abide by USDA organic labeling regulations. Processor criteria include specific sections from each pillar that must be verified by on-site audit for any products carrying Gold Regenerative Organic Certified® claims.

Labeling guidelines for manufacturing and final products are described in detail in the "Regenerative Organic Certified® Labeling Guidelines & Terms of Use and the Supply Chain Guidelines."

The Soil Health & Land Management, Animal Welfare, and Farmer & Worker Fairness modules contain criteria for each level of certification, which provide guidance that operations should meet depending on the level of certification sought. Criteria include practices that are:

- Required practices (R): Practices that operations must meet for an operation to be eligible for Regenerative Organic Certified® at the desired level. When a non-conformance for a Required practice is issued by the certifier, the operation has 90 days to resolve the non-conformance.

- Optional practices (O): Practices that are encouraged for all, but not required, at a particular level. Optional Practices (O) shift to Required Practices (R) as a producer advances from Bronze to Silver to Gold levels.

- Critical tolerances (CT): Practices that require action on the part of producers and must be reported immediately and remediated within 30 days. If the Critical Tolerance (CT) is not resolved within 30 days, a producer cannot claim Regenerative Organic Certified®.

To achieve the desired level of Regenerative Organic Certified®, an operation must meet 100% of the required practices for that level. Participation at any level of Regenerative Organic Certified® requires that the entity is properly certified as organic by a NOP-accredited certifying body and complies with all NOP requirements.

## IV. Demonstration of Compliance

All levels of Regenerative Organic Certified® require producers to be in compliance with local, provincial/state and national laws for animal welfare, labor rights, and land management. In addition, USDA organic requirements (or their international equivalents) are a baseline for Regenerative Organic Certified®; therefore, producers must comply with all geographically-appropriate organic certification requirements. No provision of this Framework or any element of the Regenerative Organic Certified® program shall be read or applied in a manner that is inconsistent with NOP requirements or policies.

The highest requirement, whether local law or Regenerative Organic Certified®, applies for each of the sections in the standard.

To demonstrate compliance, Regenerative Organic Certified® operations must maintain a current Regenerative Organic System Plan. The template is available at RegenOrganic.org/Resources.

Compliance is further demonstrated by successfully receiving certification from existing standards listed in the "Required Baseline Certifications and Equivalency Assessment" available at RegenOrganic.org/Resources, as well as by undergoing third-party audits for additional criteria required under Regenerative Organic Certified®. In order to avoid redundant work and to conduct efficient audits, third-party auditors will only audit for additional requirements not found in existing certifications.

### Cost Structure

The ROA exists to promote regenerative organic certification as the highest standard for agriculture around the world. We aim to empower eaters and farmers to create a better world through regenerative organic farming. The ROA has established competitively priced program fees for the Regenerative Organic Certified® program in a manner that is accessible to farms of all size and scope.

The ROA values our global community of regenerative organic producers and aims to establish a financially accessible, transparent fee structure. The Regenerative Organic Certified® "Cost & Fee Structure" document available at RegenOrganic.org/Resources outlines the estimated certification costs for farmers, supply chain actors, and brand owners.

While costs will vary depending on the size and scope of the operation, geographic location, projected production value, and product claims, the value proposition of the Regenerative Organic Certified® trademark is high. All available resources will be utilized to support farmers on the journey to Regenerative Organic Certified®.

## V. Soil Health & Land Management

The Soil Health & Land Management module of Regenerative Organic Certified® seeks to facilitate the adoption of agricultural practices that build, rather than degrade, soils by increasing soil organic matter, biodiversity, and fertility.

## VIII. Appendix

### A-1 Glossary of Key Terms

#### Soil Health and Land Management

- **Agroforestry**: The practice of incorporating cultivation and conservation of trees as part of an agricultural operation. Agroforestry enhances soil protection, carbon sequestration, soil moisture retention rates, & biodiversity, while increasing income due to the simultaneous production of trees and crops.

- **Biodiversity**: Biodiversity, or biological diversity, is the diversity of life existing at three levels: genetic, species, and ecosystem. Biodiversity includes variety in all forms of life, from bacteria and fungi to grasses, ferns, trees, insects, and mammals. It encompasses the diversity found at all levels of organization, from genetic differences between individuals and populations (groups of related individuals) to the types of natural communities (groups of interacting species) found in a particular area. Biodiversity also includes the full range of natural processes upon which life depends, such as nutrient cycling, carbon and nitrogen fixation, predation, symbiosis and natural succession. Regenerative Organic Certified® requirements in the Soil pillar work towards increasing biodiversity above and below the ground.

- **Carbon Sequestration**: The process by which atmospheric carbon dioxide is taken up by trees, grasses, and other plants through photosynthesis and stored as carbon in biomass (trunks, branches, foliage, and roots) and soils. For agricultural operations, increased carbon sequestration may be achieved through, for example, reduced tillage practices, complex crop rotations which include forages and green manure crops, agroforestry, reforestation, or the use of biomass-containing amendments.

- **Compost**: Compost, when properly managed, results in a high-quality soil amendment. Adding compost may increase the water holding capacity of the soil, helping farmers to produce a good crop even in years of low precipitation. Compost improves soil structure and stability, recycles nutrients, stabilizes volatile nitrogen, converts wastes into resources and suppresses soil-borne diseases. The composting process destroys weed seeds and pathogenic microorganisms, while beneficial microorganisms grow and multiply in great numbers. Synthetic fertilizers can provide soluble nutrients for plant growth, but do not build the soil's long-term biological reserves as well as compost does, and therefore are not permitted under Regenerative Organic Certified®.

- **Crop Rotation**: Crop rotation is a systematic approach of growing different annual and herbaceous perennial crops in succession in the same field. The goals of crop rotation are to help manage organic soil fertility and also to help avoid or reduce problems with diseases, pests and weeds. The more complex and long the rotation, the greater the benefits. Seven year rotations that include at least three years of herbaceous perennials are ideal for building soil health. Crop rotations as such are not applicable to woody perennial cropping systems such as orchards and vineyards.

- **Green Manure Crops**: Cover crops grown specifically for soil building. These typically include shallow tilling to incorporate the crop while it is still green. Roller crimping or irrigating after laying down the crop is an alternative way to help the green manure crop break down, especially in perennial systems.

- **Invasive Species**: Invasive plants and animals that are non-native (or alien) to the ecosystem under consideration and whose introduction causes or is likely to cause economic or environmental harm or harm to human health. Invasive species can be plants, animals, and other organisms (e.g. microbes). Human actions are the primary means of invasive species introductions.

- **Pasture**: Pasture is a land use type having vegetation cover comprised primarily of native or introduced forage species that is used for livestock grazing.

- **Perennial Crops**: Crops which are alive year-round and are harvested multiple times before dying. Apples and alfalfa are examples of perennials (apples being a woody perennial and alfalfa an herbaceous perennial) that are already commercially grown and harvested. Perennial plants develop much greater root mass than annual crops and protect the soil year-round, leaving fields less vulnerable to wind, water, and soil erosion.

- **Riparian Areas**: Plant communities contiguous to and affected by surface and subsurface hydrologic features of perennial or intermittent moving and standing water bodies (e.g. rivers, streams, lakes, or drainage ways). Riparian areas have one or both of the following characteristics: 1) distinctly different vegetative species than adjacent areas, and 2) species similar to adjacent areas but exhibiting more vigorous or robust growth forms. Riparian areas are usually transitional between wetland and upland.

- **Rotational Grazing**: Rotational grazing is a livestock production system where livestock graze in one portion (a paddock) of a pasture that has been divided into several paddocks. Livestock are systematically moved from paddock to paddock based on the stage of growth of the forages and on the objectives of the grazing system. While one paddock is being grazed, the rest of the pasture rests. This rest and recovery time maintains forage plants and builds soil organic matter.

- **Silvopasture**: A form of agroforestry, the practice of combining forestry and grazing of animals in a mutually beneficial way. A properly managed silvopasture operation enhances soil protection and increases long-term incomes due to the simultaneous production of trees and grazing animals.

- **Soil Health**: Soil health, also referred to as soil quality, is defined as the continued capacity of soil to function as a vital living ecosystem that sustains plants, animals, and humans. Soil isn't an inert growing medium, but rather is teaming with billions of bacteria, fungi, and other microbes that are the foundation of an elegant symbiotic ecosystem. Soil is an ecosystem that can be managed to provide nutrients for plant growth, absorb and hold rainwater for use during dryer periods, filter and buffer potential pollutants from leaving our fields, serve as a firm foundation for agricultural activities, and provide habitat for soil microbes to flourish and diversify to keep the ecosystem running smoothly. Improving soil health is one of the key targets of Regenerative Organic Certified®.

- **Tillage**: Preparation of soil by mechanical agitation of various types, such as digging, stirring, and overturning. Biological principles and mechanical termination of cover crops may reduce or eliminate the need for tilling. Tillage operations can be divided into the following categories:
  - Primary tillage: Operations include the use of the moldboard plow, chisel plow, or disk plow. It is often the most intensive form of tillage. For example, moldboard plowing inverts the soil over the entire field. Primary tillage marks the end of one cropping season and the beginning of the next and creates a dramatic visible change on the landscape.
  - Secondary tillage: Operations used to prepare the seedbed. This may include the use of tandem or off-set disks, field cultivator, harrows, packers and coulters.
  - Tertiary tillage: Operations that disturb the soil during seeding, management, or harvesting the crop

- **Vegetative Cover**: A vegetative cover is the maintenance of plants in place to reduce soil erosion and prevent desiccation of soil microbial communities, resulting from soil left exposed. Vegetative cover will suppress weeds, recycle nutrients back to the soil, increase soil organic matter, sequester carbon in the soil, increase soil moisture and reduce erosion. Maintaining a living vegetative cover year round is ideal, but not possible for most annual production systems.

#### Animal Welfare

- **Body Condition Score**: A system of measuring how thin or fat an animal is by reference to a standardized scale.

- **Carrying Capacity**: The average number of animals that can be rotationally grazed on a given area of pasture for a year without harming it. It is a measure of a pasture's ability to produce enough forage to meet the requirements of grazing animals.

- **Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFO)**: Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs), as defined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), are lots or facilities (other than an aquatic animal production facility) where animals have been, are, or will be stabled or confined and fed or maintained for a total of 45 days or more in any 12-month period. Crops, vegetation, forage growth, or post-harvest residues are not sustained in the normal growing season over any portion of the lot or facility. The EPA provides specific thresholds by animal sector for small, medium, and large CAFOs. For example, a large CAFO for beef cattle is defined as 1,000 or more "animal units" confined for over 45 days a year.

- **Commercial Livestock Operation**: Animals are raised with the primary purpose of generating a profit. Non-commercial animals are those that generally have functions outside of or alongside profit, such as draught power, transport, manure production, or for educational purposes. The Five Freedoms described below must be demonstrated for all animals. Contact the ROA for additional guidance on determining if your livestock operation is considered commercial under the Regenerative Organic Certified®.

- **Dehorning**: The practice of removing or routinely trimming/tipping horns. To earn Regenerative Organic Certified®, dehorning and routine trimming/tipping of horns are prohibited. The use of polled breeds is recommended. Trimming of the horns is only permitted for medical purposes when the health of the cow is negatively affected by their horn length (e.g., horn tips are rubbing the eyes) or when the length could negatively impact the welfare of other animals, but this procedure must be performed by an experienced individual using a method of low-stress handling and restraint along with adequate analgesic and anesthetic pain control. Additionally, trimming must avoid the live innervated tissue within the horns.

- **Disbudding**: The removal or destruction of horn-producing cells before an animal's horns become attached to its skull. To earn Regenerative Organic Certified®, this practice is prohibited in calves over three weeks of age. Hot iron cauterization allowed up to three weeks of age, which must be preceded and followed by administration of appropriate anesthetic and analgesia to provide short- and long-term pain relief. The procedure must be performed by an experienced individual using low stress handling and restraint techniques (e.g., sedation, disbudding crate). Any other methods of disbudding prohibited (e.g., caustic paste, scooping). The use of polled breeds is recommended over disbudding practices. If Regenerative Organic Certified® producers disbud, they must demonstrate they are incorporating polled genetics via semen purchase for artificial insemination, herd bull selection, or replacement cow purchase. Producers who are disbudding must use polled genetics for breeding at least 20% of their cow herd year over year or until their calves no longer require disbudding. If the producer is unable to find suitable polled genetics, a record detailing efforts made to source the genetics and why such efforts were unsuccessful must be made available to the inspector for review at each inspection.

- **Five Freedoms**: The Animal Welfare module leverages the five freedoms for animal welfare, which include:
  1. Freedom from hunger or thirst by ready access to fresh water and a diet to maintain full health and vigor
  2. Freedom from discomfort by providing an appropriate environment including shelter and a comfortable resting area
  3. Freedom from pain, injury, and disease by prevention or rapid diagnosis and treatment
  4. Freedom to express normal behaviors by providing sufficient space, proper facilities and company of the animal's own kind
  5. Freedom from fear and distress by ensuring conditions and treatment that avoid mental suffering

- **Handling**: The handling of animals covers the general treatment of animals during the various tasks performed and requirements of an operation. To minimize stress, pain, and suffering to an animal, Regenerative Organic Certified® prohibits certain practices, such as prodding (jabbing of animal with instrument), wattling (cutting chunks out of an animal's hide to hang under the animal's neck), and dehorning (removal of horns).

- **Mobile Harvesting Unit**: A mobile harvest unit, or mobile slaughterhouse, enables livestock and poultry farmers to slaughter their animals humanely on-site. This decreases the exposure of animals to stressful and inhumane treatment at large scale slaughter facilities.

- **Monogastrics**: Monogastric animals have a simple single-chambered stomach and include dogs, pigs, horses, and rabbits. Their ability to extract energy from cellulose digestion is less efficient than in ruminants, and therefore are permitted to feed on grains.

- **Non-Ambulatory Animals**: Animals that cannot rise from a recumbent position or that cannot walk, including, but not limited to, those with broken appendages, severed tendons or ligaments, nerve paralysis, fractured vertebral column, or metabolic conditions.

- **Ruminants**: Ruminant species include cud-chewing animals such as cows, goats, bison, and sheep. Ruminants are designed to eat fibrous grasses, plants, and shrubs. A high-grain diet may cause physical problems for ruminants. Additionally, when ruminants are switched from pasture to grain, they can become afflicted with numerous disorders, including a common but painful condition called "subacute acidosis."

#### Farmer and Worker Fairness

- **Atypical Employment**: The use of labor-only contracting arrangements, consecutive short-term contracts and/or false apprenticeship or other schemes by the organization to avoid meeting its obligations to personnel under applicable laws and regulations pertaining to labor and social security.

- **Capacity Building**: The process of developing and strengthening the skills, instincts, abilities, processes, and resources to improve the social and economic position of farmers and workers.

- **Democratic Organizations (International)**: The ability for small-scale farmers to be democratically organized in order to be able to compete globally.

- **Equal Opportunity**: The policy of treating job applicants or employees equally without regard to the person's race, color, gender, pregnancy, sexual orientation, disability, marital status, age, religion, political opinion, national extraction, social origin, or other personal characteristics.

- **Fair Payments**: Payment sufficient to cover cost of production including living wages for any workers and equivalent income to farmers, plus reinvestment in farm.

- **Family Members**: Those relatives who are related in direct line to the producer and live in the same household as the producer. It may include parents, spouses, brothers/sisters and children, but does not include aunts/uncles, cousins or other relatives.

- **Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining**: The method whereby representatives of workers (unions) and producers (farmers/ranchers) negotiate the conditions of employment, often resulting in a written contract setting forth the wages, hours, and other conditions to be observed for a stipulated period. Collective bargaining should be conducted in good faith.

- **Living Wage**: The remuneration received for a standard work week by a worker in a particular place sufficient to afford a decent standard of living for the worker and her or his family. Elements of a decent standard of living include food, water, housing, education, health care, transport, clothing, and other essential needs including provision for unexpected events.

- **Routine Workplace Audits**: Routine third-party audits should assess that producers minimize exposure to disease, ensure access to safe inputs, provide clean facilities, document identification procedures, record use of treatment products, and properly train workers on the operation's protocols.

- **Smallholder**: Small farming operations where land and labor productivity are comparatively low due to limited resources. Smallholder farmers often rely on farming as a primary means of livelihood and are at greater risk of vulnerability in the supply chain. Smallholders rely primarily on family labor for farm operations. Smallholder size may vary by farm type and commodity; however, some certifications set thresholds so confirm with your certification program, if applicable. Most smallholders are organized by Internal Control System (ICS) for certification purposes. Contact the ROA for additional guidance on determining if your operation is considered a smallholder under the Regenerative Organic Certified®.

- **Trafficked Labor**: Any work performed by a person who has been recruited, transported, harbored or obtained by means of the use of threat, force, coercion or deception for the purpose of exploitation.

### A-3. Living Wage Calculation and Definitions

#### Living Wage Definition 
For the purposes of the Regenerative Organic Certified®, a living wage is defined as:   
A combination of wages and benefits that can provide for food, water, housing, education, health care, transport, clothing, and other essential 
needs, plus a 10% allowance for unexpected events and/or savings.   
 
#### Living Wage Calculation 
Living wage must be calculated using one of the following methods or tools:   
- Agricultural Justice Project Living Wage Toolkit   
- MIT Calculator + 10%, based on one working adult   
- Global Living Wages benchmarks per region   
- Global Living Wage Coalition calculation manual   
- Fair Labor Association benchmarks   
- Anker Methodology by the Global Living Wage Coalition 
- Calculation in accordance with SAI Guidance Document for Social Accountability 8000 (SA8000, 2004) definition for “basic needs wage”:   
  - A “basic needs wage” enables workers to support half the average-sized family above the poverty line, based on local prices near the workplace. Basic needs include essential expenses such as food, clean water, clothes, shelter, transport, education, a discretionary income, as well as legally mandated social benefits (which may include health care, medical insurance, unemployment insurance, retirement plan, and so on).   


### A-4. Operation Scale Definitions

  - A maximum of 1/3 of member farms may have up to 2 times the parameters defined   
- Large-scale farms/farm organizations 
  - All other situations 

### A-5. Auditor Requirements for All Modules of Regenerative Organic Certified®

Auditor remuneration is not incentive based, nor based on the outcome of inspections. All approved auditors must receive initial training as well as continuous education and periodic evaluation.

Visual inspections should be approached with collaboration and mutual respect towards suppliers at all levels, with a focus on education and sustainable remediation. Farm, ranch, or facility visits are preferred during the production cycle, with special attention paid to periods of increased risk to animal welfare, such as castration or other mutilations, birthing, shearing, loading, and similar. The scope of the on-site audit should include, but is not limited to, a walk- through of the facility and review of the following items: 

- Visual inspection of the treatment of the workers and animals (if applicable to the entity); 
- Visual inspection of the workers’ and animals’ environment (if applicable to the entity); 
- Review of product labeling practices and procedures; 
- Review of segregation and separation practices and procedures; 
- Review of traceable supply chain process implementation; 
- Worker interviews to ensure proper implementation of traceability policies, procedures, documentation, training, and animal welfare 
legal compliance; 
- Issues identified during the document review; 
- Complaint policies; 
- All other requirements as required by Regenerative Organic Certified®.

Documentation required to demonstrate compliance must be made available for review during the audit or pre-audit process at all levels of the supply chain. Additionally, auditors must be allowed to conduct private management and worker interviews in the local language at all levels of the supply chain to assess proper implementation of traceability policies, procedures, and documentation, training, and animal welfare compliance. The maximum period between on-site assessments should not be more than 18 months.
