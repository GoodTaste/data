## Introduction

This 6-3-4™ Verification Standard from Regenified™ reflects decades of on-farm and in-lab research on regenerative agricultural practices. This document represents a way for an entire system (food/fiber/fuel companies, farmers, ranchers, and consumers) to make better decisions about what to grow and eat. Our Standard is designed to move entire supply chains toward regenerative agriculture, yielding improved climate effects for our planet and positive health benefits for the people on it.

Regenified's 6-3-4™ Verification Standard is based on six principles of soil health, three rules of adaptive stewardship, and four ecosystem processes. This standard helps farmers and ranchers understand where their practices and lands are on the regenerative path. Financial incentives are also essential to help align human behavior with the needs of the planet. These incentives and the contracts, licenses, and agreements that support such transformation are not addressed in this verification standard.

3.1.2. Farm or ranch production yield goals should be correct for their environment.

3.1.3. Plant and animal species and practices being used should be correct for their environment.

3.1.4. Birthing periods must be correct for the context of the area and operation.

3.1.5. Farm/ranch should be evaluated for and addressing the root cause of problems/resource concerns on the land.

3.1.6. Farm/ranch must participate in regenerative ag educational groups.

3.1.7. Farm/ranch should have a succession plan in place.

### 3.2. Principle of Disturbance

#### On Farm Evaluation for All Annually Planted Crops

3.2.1. For Tier 2 there must be a reduction in tillage passes from conventional production practices to current production practices. For Tier 3 there can be no more than one tillage pass per year. For Tier 4 there can be no more than one tillage pass every 2 years. For Tier 5 there can be no more than one tillage pass every 4 years. Tillage passes include all full width and row cultivation in addition to planting. For a multiple year rotation without tillage followed by an occasional tillage pass, divide tillage passes by the years in the rotation for a percentage listed in parenthesis in the table below.

3.2.2. Injected fertility should be applied with a low disturbance applicator. If a high disturbance applicator is used, it also counts as a tillage pass. For Tier 4-5 a low disturbance applicator must be used. If nothing is injected then it scores a N/A.

3.2.3. Over the entire cropping rotation there must be a reduction in pesticide (herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, seed treatments, etc) pounds of active ingredient and number of applications to move from one tier to the next higher tier. Additionally, no chemical pesticides may be used on grains in the 21 days prior to harvest. This includes applications meant to be a harvest aid only.

3.2.4. Prior to the use of any pesticide (herbicides, fungicides, insecticides), a basic pest management plan must be developed and approved by the Regenified Verification Review Board. Threshold values and locations should be determined for all target pests. The plan should include: 1) expected target pests, 2) planned monitoring strategies and treatment thresholds, 3) planned chemical suppression techniques including rates and timing 4) alternatives considered such as cultural, biological, or mechanical suppression techniques.

#### Perennial Crops (Native rangeland, introduced pasture, vineyards, orchards, etc.)

3.2.5. The recovery period between disturbance events (grazing, trampling, whole plant biomass removal, burning, etc), should be long enough to ensure full recovery on most perennial plants in the management area.

3.2.6. The disturbance event (grazing, trampling, whole plant biomass removal, burning, etc) should be short enough to prevent continued impact on plants after regrowth has started during the same disturbance event time period.

3.2.8. Areas used for whole plant biomass removal (haying, silage, biofuel, etc.) should be rotated annually.

3.2.9. Whole plant biomass should be fed where it was harvested.

3.2.10. For Tier 2-3, whole plant biomass should not be sold or exported from the farm.

3.2.11. For Tier 4-5, whole plant biomass must not be sold or exported from the farm.

3.2.12. There should be a reduction in acres where whole plant biomass is removed from previous evaluations.

3.2.13. To move to the next higher tier there must be a reduction in rate or applications of pesticides used on grasslands from the previous tier.

3.2.14. Prior to the use of any pesticide (herbicides, fungicides, insecticides), a basic pest management plan must be developed and approved by the Regenified Verification Review Board. Threshold values and locations should be determined for all target pests. The plan should include: 1) expected target pests, 2) planned monitoring strategies and treatment thresholds, 3) planned chemical suppression techniques including rates and timing 4) alternatives considered such as cultural, biological, or mechanical suppression techniques.

3.6.2. All livestock must have access to adequate space to move about, express their natural habits, and have access to feed and water on a continual basis.

#### POULTRY

The goal for poultry management in layers or broiler operations should be to train or entice the birds to utilize areas outside of their poultry house for their natural activities such as foraging, eating insects, and dusting. Training a flock to go outside can be accomplished with herding techniques or with enticements such as water sources, shrubs, and trees that provide shade or vegetation that attracts insects. With proper training and enticements a significant amount of outside flock activity can be achieved.

3.6.3. Poultry in stationary houses must have adequate shade for a significant portion of the flock. Generally this area should be at least 25% of the house size. Shade should be spaced appropriately across the available area. For Tiers 2 and 3 shade can be artificial. For Tiers 4 and 5 at least 25% of required shade must be natural from trees or shrubs.

3.6.4. Stationary poultry houses must have doors with adequate locations and size to allow the majority of the flock both visual and physical access outside.

3.6.5. Stationary poultry houses should achieve daily outside activity on a minimum of 40% of the flock.

3.6.6. Poultry in portable structures with a covered roof that are moved frequently across a pasture or other vegetated area are not subject to the secondary shade requirements.

#### GRAZING LIVESTOCK

3.6.7. Grazing animals such as cattle, sheep, swine and goats cannot be in concrete or bare dirt confinement more than 60 days total over their life for any activities.

3.6.8. All livestock must be grazed according to an adaptive management grazing plan.

3.6.10. Antibiotics and/or hormone treatments must not be used in any livestock prophylactically for pathogens or as growth stimulants.

3.6.11. Tiers 1 and 2 do not have any regenerative feed requirements for livestock.

3.6.12. For Tier 3, livestock operations must have 40-60% of annual feed inputs including grazing, on-farm produced, or purchased feed produced regeneratively meeting Regenified's standard.

For Tier 4, livestock operations must have 60-80% of annual feed inputs including grazing, on-farm produced, or purchased feed produced regeneratively meeting Regenified's standard.

For Tier 5, livestock operations must have 80-100% of annual feed inputs including grazing, on-farm produced, or purchased feed produced regeneratively meeting Regenified's standard.

Other examples could include a severe personal or family member injury or emergency.

5.5.2. A landowner could be called on to provide additional information or documentation for this secondary review as well as an interview if requested by the board.

5.5.3. If it is determined that circumstances beyond the producer's control contributed to the adverse determination, the producer will be given a one year exception and will be required to submit a remediation plan outlining steps to be taken.
